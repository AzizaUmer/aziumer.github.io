## About me
This is Aziza Umer Yibrie’s (አዚዛ ኡመር ይብሬ ) academic web page. 

## Short intro:  
I am Aziza Umer, a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia. My research focuses on AI in healthcare, integrating Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop intelligent tools for low-resource settings. 

I have worked on projects including sentiment analysis for Amharic text and Ethiopian license plate detection. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from Bahir Dar University and have prepared papers on systematic literature reviews and sentiment analysis. I have also submitted a paper to a journal and am currently awaiting review.

My work aims to improve access to AI-driven solutions in healthcare, addressing challenges such as language barriers and limited data availability.
